🎨 Prompt for Figma / AI Design Assistant

Prompt for Figma (or a design AI like Uizard or Galileo):
“Design a modern, elegant website layout for a fashion designer brand called Lolu Apparel. The site should have sections for hero introduction, about the designer, collections (ready-made store), custom tailoring service, event décor service, testimonials, and contact form. Use soft neutral tones (white, beige, light gray) with gold or blush pink accents. Fonts: Playfair Display for headings, Poppins for body. Include lifestyle images of clothes, fabrics, and decorated event venues. The overall feel should be classy, professional, and creative — suitable for a personal brand that blends fashion and event planning.”


Would you like me to create a wireframe sketch (layout map) of this so you can easily use it as reference when designing in Figma?
